# Documentation

This folder contains the documentation for Audiofunctions+. It has been prepared using [quarto](https://quarto.org/).

These are the basic steps to build the documentation locally:

- To preview, use `quarto preview` in the `docs` folder.
- To render the documentation, use `quarto render` in the `docs` folder.

You can publish the documentation to GitHub Pages by using `quarto publish gh-pages` in the `docs` folder. However, this step is already automated using GitHub Actions.

# Audiofunctions+

Audiofunctions+ is a web app designed to facilitate visually impaired students’ learning of mathematical functions. Audiofunctions+ allows users to interpret the shape of a function’s graph by listening to its sonification.  
Audiofunctions+ is one of the deliverables of the [SONAIRGRAPH](https://sonairgraph.unito.it/) Erasmus+ project.
